I'm documenting my research journey into distributed machine learning. This blog explores how resource-constrained embedded systems—like ESP32 microcontrollers—can coordinate through swarm intelligence algorithms to perform distributed machine learning tasks.

**Core Question:** How can we build robust, scalable machine learning systems using swarms of resource-constrained devices?

I'm combining my background in machine learning and embedded systems with cutting-edge research in edge AI and bio-inspired computing. The target application? Wildlife monitoring using autonomous sensor networks.
