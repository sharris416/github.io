# Welcome to My TinyML Swarm Intelligence Journey

Welcome to my TinyML Swarm Intelligence journey. I am documenting my research journey into distributed machine learning as a way to focus and build on a number of personal and professional interests. This blog explores how resource-constrained embedded systems—like ESP32 microcontrollers—can coordinate through swarm intelligence algorithms to perform distributed machine learning tasks.

**Core Question:** How can we build robust, scalable machine learning systems using swarms of resource-constrained devices?

I'm combining machine learning and embedded systems with edge AI and bio-inspired computing. I have included a great deal of math learning as part of this, both out of interest, but also because it is probably the area I need to work on the most as part of this project. Additional areas include electronics and solar power, mesh technology, and constrained programming environments. The initial target application? Wildlife monitoring using autonomous sensor networks.
