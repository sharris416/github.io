## 📖 About This Blog

Blogging my way though a 12-month TinyML Swarm Intelligence journey. I'm exploring how resource-constrained embedded systems (like ESP32 microcontrollers) can coordinate through swarm intelligence algorithms to perform distributed machine learning tasks.

### Background

I hold a **Master's in Information Systems** with a thesis on machine learning for educational analytics. My technical interests span:
- Embedded systems (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32)
- Vintage computing (6502 assembly on VIC-20)
- Mesh networking (Meshtastic)
- Linux systems programming

This blog bridges my existing skills with cutting-edge research in edge AI and bio-inspired computing.

## 🎯 Research Focus

**Core Question:** *How can we build robust, scalable machine learning systems using swarms of resource-constrained devices?*

**Key Areas:**
- TinyML model deployment on microcontrollers
- Federated learning for distributed systems
- Bio-inspired swarm algorithms (ant colonies, bee democracy, flocking)
- Consensus mechanisms in mesh networks
- Energy-efficient edge computing

**Target Application:** Wildlife monitoring using autonomous sensor networks
